Full Calendar is open to contributions!

- If you want to develop locally, make sure to make a symbolic link from `main.css` to `styles.css`. Obsidian expects a css file called `styles.css`, but esbuild will output one named `main.css`.
- You can build the plugin for development by running `npm run dev`.
- The [hot reload plugin](https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload) makes development a lot easier.

To start getting familiar with the codebase, check out the architecture guide at [`src/README.md`](https://github.com/davish/obsidian-full-calendar/blob/main/src/README.md).
