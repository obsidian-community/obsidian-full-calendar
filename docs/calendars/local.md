# Local calendar with full notes as events

Keep each event in a calendar as a separate note in your Obsidian vault. This is currently the only option for editable events in Full Calendar. Events are stored as frontmatter on notes that is set and updated by the Full Calendar plugin when [managing events](../events/manage.md) in the calendar.

You are free to add any additional frontmatter to the notes, as well as any text content, like a description of the event, meeting notes, or anything else.

The note title is also managed by the plugin in the format `<YYYY-MM-DD> <Event title>`.md.
