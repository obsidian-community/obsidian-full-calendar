# Getting started

## Welcome page

Open Full Calendar from the command palette or the ribbon icon for the first time and you'll be prompted to add a calendar. It's recommended that you add either a [Daily Note calendar](calendars/dailynote) or a [full note calendar](calendars/local) based in a directory in your Vault so that you can create and modify events. Remote calendars are currently read-only.
