# Obsidian Full Calendar

Keep your calendar in your vault! This plugin integrates the [FullCalendar](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar) library into your Obsidian Vault so that you can keep your ever-changing daily schedule and special events and plans alongside your tasks and notes, and link freely between all of them. Each event is stored as a separate note with special frontmatter so you can take notes, form connections and add context to any event on your calendar.

Most of this documentation is presented as GIF walkthroughs. If something is unclear, don't hesitate to [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/davish/obsidian-full-calendar/issues) or comment on an existing one.
