# [Deprecated] mirror Google Calendar via GCal API

The only benefit of the GCal-specific sync method is that each event will link to the GCal event in your browser when you click on it. If clicking to go to GCal isn't important to you or you want to keep your calendar private, you should use the .ics sync above.

There are a few steps you'll need to do to add a Google Calendar to Obsidian:

1. [GCal] Go to calendar settings.
2. [GCal] Share calendar with the public. Make sure the dropdown is set to "see all event details".
3. [GCal] Copy your `Calendar ID` from the "Integrate calendar" section in settings.
4. [Obsidian] Add a new calendar in settings, set the type to `Google Calendar (readonly)`, and choose your color
